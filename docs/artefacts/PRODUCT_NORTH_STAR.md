Purpose

GrantPilot exists to help NGOs decide whether to apply for a grant and produce a submission-ready proposal, without wasting time or over-relying on generic AI.

Target User

Small to mid-sized NGOs

Limited grant-writing capacity

Applying to competitive institutional funders

Operating in UK, US, India, and Global South

Core Problem

NGOs waste significant time:

Applying to ineligible or poor-fit opportunities

Writing proposals without clarity on readiness, compliance, or evidence

Core Solution

GrantPilot provides:

Fit Scan (eligibility, alignment, readiness, risk)

Consultant-grade drafting workflow

Readiness checks before submission

What GrantPilot Is NOT

A funding guarantee

A probability-of-success predictor

A donor intermediary

A replacement for funder due diligence
