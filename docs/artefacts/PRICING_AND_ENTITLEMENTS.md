## Quota Accounting Rules
- Quota is decremented only after successful completion of the action:
  - Fit Scan → after valid result is generated
  - Proposal → after initial draft is generated
  - Regeneration → after regenerated content is generated successfully
- Failed or timed-out operations do not consume quota
- Quota checks and decrements must be atomic and transactional


“Entitlements endpoint may initialize paid-plan period boundaries once if missing (fallback until Stripe sets billing cycle).”

## Export Rules (MVP)
- DOCX export is supported.
- PDF export is not supported.
