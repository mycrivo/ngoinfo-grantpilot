## Decision Logic

1. Eligibility (Hard Gate)
   - Any fail → Not Recommended

2. Alignment (0–100)
   - <50 → Not Recommended
   - 50–75 → Apply with Caveats
   - >75 → Recommended

3. Readiness Adjustments
   - Missing projects, unclear budget → downgrade by one level

4. Conservative Default
   - If confidence <70% → Apply with Caveats

## Guardrails

- Never imply funding success
- Never show probabilities
- Use conservative, advisory language only

## Fallback
- AI failure → no partial results
- User sees retry prompt
